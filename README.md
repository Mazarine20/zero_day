# Project Summary - Zero Day

Welcome to Zero Day, my repository as a full-stack engineer! The purpose of this project is to establish a solid foundation in using Git and GitHub. The main objectives include setting up Git on my local machine, creating a repository named "zero_day" on GitHub, and successfully pushing a README file to the remote server.

## Repository Information

- GitHub repository: [zero_day](https://github.com/your-username/zero_day)
- File: README.md

## Project Goals

1. Configure Git: Ensure Git is properly installed and configured on our local machine. Set up our basic information, such as our name and email, which will be associated with our commits.

2. Create "zero_day" Repository: Using the GitHub website's graphical interface, create a new repository named "zero_day" with the following details:
   - Description: This repository represents my first project as a full-stack engineer.
   - Public repository: The repository should be publicly accessible.
   - No README, .gitignore, or license: These files will be added and configured separately.

3. Push README.md File: On our local machine, navigate to our home directory, then create a directory named "zero_day". Move into this new directory, initialize Git, and add the remote origin for the "zero_day" repository. Create a file named README.md using a command-line editor (e.g., Emacs) and write a concise Markdown text summarizing the goals and objectives of the project. Add this new file to Git, commit the change with the message "My first commit," and push the commit to the remote server.
